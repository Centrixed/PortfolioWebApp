# ASP.NET Portfolio Web App

I am currently building a portfolio web app to represent my previous and current work history in a pleasing and entertaining format. 

As I have been looking to fully transition into a front-end developer, I quickly realized how out of touch I have become with modern API's and front-end development tools. Therefore I decided to build my portfolio website by learning to use the tools and frameworks that I had been previously lacking experience with. 

This web app is being built with:
- ASP.NET Core
- React.js
- Bootstrap
- Azure Cloud Storage

The goal is to host this web app on my domain (mattunderation.com). It will contain your average portfolio website content (My projects, about me,...etc), as well as some interactive demo's to show my knowledge of React and ASP.NET.
